    "* Bayesian statistics mostly involves conditional probability (the probability of an event given that another event has occured)\n",
    "* Bayes' Rule - the conditional probability of A given B is given by P(A|B) = P(A & B) / P(B)\n",
    "* False positive - test returns positive while the truth is negative\n",
    "* False negative - test returns negative while the truth is positive\n",
    "* Bayes' updating - process of using Bayes' rule to update a probability based on an event affecting it\n",
    "* Prior - the probability of an event before any evidence is taken into account\n",
    "* Posterior - the probability of an event after evidence is taken into account\n"
