    "    * Frequentist - go to U.S. Census record and determine what proportion of people get married\n",
    "    * Bayesian - thinks \"My cousin is brilliant attractive and fun. The probability that my cousin gets married is really high\" and assigns a value based on that\n",
    "* Bayesian will seek to express their belief about the value of p through a probability distribution, a very flexible family of distributions for this is the beta family\n",
